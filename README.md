## About
*Stipple Effect* is a pixel art editor that supports animation and scripting. It is designed to facilitate a variety of workflows and to encourage rapid, iterative creation of video game art assets and other types of artwork.

* made by a solo game developer with the needs and skill sets of other indie devs in mind
* lightweight and simple to learn and use, yet allows for considerable depth and complexity
* expressive scripting API that can be used to **automate program actions** and **create dynamic preview and color transformations with complex logic**

## Scripting
_Stipple Effect_ supports scripts have three main uses: **automation**, **custom previews** and **color transformation**. It is highly recommended for users that want to get the most out of the program to read the API and familiarize themselves with its potential applications.
