## About
*Stipple Effect* is a pixel art editor that supports animation and scripting. It is designed to facilitate a variety of workflows and to encourage rapid, iterative creation of video game art assets and other types of artwork.

* made by a solo game developer with the needs and skill sets of other indie devs in mind
* lightweight and simple to learn and use, yet allows for considerable depth and complexity
* expressive scripting API that can be used to **automate program actions** and **create dynamic preview and color transformations with complex logic**

## Scripting
*Stipple Effect* scripts have three main uses: [**automation**](https://stipple-effect.github.io/docs/automation-scripts), [**custom previews**](https://stipple-effect.github.io/docs/preview-scripts) and [**color transformations**](https://stipple-effect.github.io/docs/color-scripts). It is highly recommended for users that want to get the most out of the program to read the API specification and familiarize themselves with its potential applications.

* [API specification](https://stipple-effect.github.io/api/)
* [Example scripts](https://github.com/stipple-effect/script-examples)

I have created [a VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jordanbunke.deltascript-for-stipple-effect) that provides syntax highlighting for *Stipple Effect* scripts.

## External Dependencies
* [Delta Time](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time) - my lightweight graphics library that handles GUI and execution loop boilerplate
* [ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) - lexing and parsing library that powers the _DeltaScript_ interpreter
* [Animation Encoder](https://github.com/jbunke/animation-encoder) - my wrapper for Square's [gifencoder](https://github.com/square/gifencoder) and for [jcodec](https://github.com/jcodec/jcodec)
